                            <p class="about__content--desc mb-20">Rhonda and Kelton are a husband-and-wife team who love to
                                travel and meet amazing people from all over the world and are inspired by their stories.
                                They both love creating art and décor items. Rhonda is licensed interior designer, has
                                degrees in merchandising and interior design. Kelton enjoys creating pastel artwork and has
                                also made beautiful carved artistic pieces. Together, they're building Sketchbook Online as
                                a forum for artists to motivate, inspire, encourage, and give back to the community. They
                                believe that art teachers connecting with students, artists connecting with buyers, and
                                artist connecting with each other for support are crucial for the future of art education.
                                This way, they can give back to the arts community in time and monetary support. Rhonda and
                                Kelton currently provide small scholarships to Texas Tech University design school and want
                                to expand the outreach to Art schools. They are involved in their small Texas Hill Country
                                community of Boerne, as well as their community church. Our philosophy is, we are a
                                faith-based company enhancing the environment through the beauty of art and design. Plus,
                                it's just plain fun to connect with other creative individuals. Client satisfaction is the
                                ultimate goal of Sketchbook Online by responding to the desire for an exceptional experience
                                as both artist or art buyer.</p>
